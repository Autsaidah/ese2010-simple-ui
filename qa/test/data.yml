                    Has the model a central position in a Play! application?

    title:          The MVC application

                    A Play! application follows the MVC architectural pattern as applied to the 
                    architecture of the Web.
                    This pattern splits the application into separate layers, but I don't know which ones.
                    Can Anybody help me?
